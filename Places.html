            <img class="img1" src="imgs/places/1.jpg" width="300" height="200">
            <p>
                Notable landmarks include the Red Keep (the royal stronghold and home of the Iron Throne) and the ruins of the Great Sept of Baelor.
                If you're thinking of visiting, don't miss the unique sights of Littlefinger's brothels,
                and the unique smells of Flea Bottom.

        <h3>The Iron Islands</h3>

            <p>
                Theon Greyjoy's dismal, salty home. The Greyjoy words are We Do Not Sow – so don't expect fertile farmlands on Great Wyk,
                Pyke and the rest, just loads of seagoing reavers, religious fanatics, sheep and probably some incest.

                Winterfell
                If you're wondering how the Starks (and, briefly, Ramsay Bolton) managed in the cold up there,
                there's a hot spring under the castle and they pump water through the walls.

        <h3>Oldtown</h3>
        <div class="div4">
            <img class="img4" src="imgs/places/4.jpg" width="300" height="200" >
            <p>A bit like a medieval Oxford or Cambridge, Oldtown is a university town, home to the Citadel,
                the enormous tower where all the country's Maesters are trained.
                Sam did a bit of book-learnin' there.

            <p>
                Casterly Rock
                It's not been shown in the series yet, but it's the home of the Lannisters,
                who are – or were, at least – literally sitting on a goldmine.

                Dragonstone Game Of ThronesHBO
                Ancestral home of the Targaryens since before Aegon's Conquest, and current dwelling place of Daemon (Matt Smith)

            <img class="img7" src="imgs/places/7.jpeg" width="300" height="200" >
            <p>
                Home of Syrio Forel, First Sword of Braavos and Arya's fencing teacher.
                The Free City is where Arya wound up after fleeing Westeros, and where she learned the ways of Jaqen H'ghar and the Faceless Men. Lots of canals,
                if you like that kind of thing, and a colossal Titan statue all on its own.

            <p>
                The Wall is a colossal fortification which stretches for 100 leagues (300 miles or 482.8 kilometers)
                along the northern border of the Kingdom of the North.
